"Truth," said a traveller, 
"Is a rock, a mighty fortress; 
Often have I been to it, 
Even to its highest tower, 
From whence the world looks black." 

"Truth," said a traveller, 
"Is a breath, a wind, 
A shadow, a phantom; 
Long have I pursued it, 
But never have I touched 
The hem of its garment." 
And I believed the second traveller; 
For truth was to me 
A breath, a wind, 
A shadow, a phantom, 
And never had I touched 
The hem of its garment.
