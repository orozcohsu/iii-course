A spirit sped 
Through spaces of night; 
And as he sped, he called, 
"God! God!" 
He went through valleys 
Of black death-slime, 
Ever calling, 
"God! God!" 
Their echoes 
From crevice and cavern 
Mocked him: 
"God! God! God!" 
Fleetly into the plains of space 
He went, ever calling, 
"God! God!" 
Eventually, then, he screamed, 
Mad in denial, 
"Ah, there is no God!" 
A swift hand, 
A sword from the sky, 
Smote him, 
And he was dead.
