A man saw a ball of gold in the sky; 
He climbed for it, 
And eventually he achieved it -- 
It was clay. 

Now this is the strange part: 
When the man went to the earth 
And looked again, 
Lo, there was the ball of gold. 
Now this is the strange part: 
It was a ball of gold. 
Aye, by the heavens, it was a ball of gold.
